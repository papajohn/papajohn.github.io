</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>What&#8217;s new in Data 8 for Spring 2017? Perhaps the biggest change is that we have
expanded the capacity of the course to 672 students. As of the first lecture,
more than 700 students were enrolled or waitlisted for the course, compared to
495 in Spring 2016. The primary course staff has grown to 50 (U)GSIs and tutors,
complemented by 55+ learning assistants. We plan to offer <a href="http://data8.org/sp17/schedule.html">24 lab sections</a>,
<a href="http://data8.org/connector">11 connector courses</a>, and 45 small-group tutoring
sessions each week. The <a href="http://data8.org/sp17/staff.html">team of students</a>
who are providing this support are truly doing amazing&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>We plan to keep the <a href="http://data8.org/sp17">topic schedule</a> and assignments from
the <a href="http://data8.org/fa16">Fall 2016 offering</a>, but streamline some parts in
order to add an extra lecture on programming during week 2 and an extra lecture
on optimization in week 13. Professor Ani Adhikari is continuing to help teach
the course with me, despite teaching two other courses including a brand new
<a href="http://data.berkeley.edu/course/probability-data-science">Probability for Data
Science</a> course that
looks very exciting to&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>One major improvement to the course is a <a href="https://github.com/data-8/jupyterhub-k8s">new deployment of JupyterHub on
Kubernetes</a> that has provided by far
the most stable first week of labs we&#8217;ve ever had, despite the increase in
course scale. We&#8217;ve also simplified assignment submission; now students can
submit their work directly to <a href="http://okpy.org"><span class="caps">OK</span></a> from within their&nbsp;notebooks.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not enrolled in the course but interested in the assignments, we now
provide access to <a href="http://datahub.berkeley.edu">datahub.berkeley.edu</a> from any
@berkeley.edu account. You&#8217;re welcome to click on any of the assignment links
on the <a href="http://data8.org/sp17">Data 8 course calendar</a> to try the assignments
interactively. If you don&#8217;t have an @berkeley.edu account, you can download
the <a href="https://github.com/data-8/data8assets/tree/gh-pages/materials/sp17">course materials from Github</a>.</p>
